This package contains a set of PKCS11 modules that make easier the life on
the Grid.  More information and latest version of the package can be found
at http://www.metacentrum.cz/en/about/devel/

The IGTF module provides access to certificates of CAs stored on the local
filesystem. It tries to load files from default location
(/etc/grid-security/certificates) and make them available to the
application. The X509_CERT_DIR environment variable can be used to specify
an alternative location of the certificates.

The proxy module interfaces the user's X.509 proxy certificate stored on the
local filesystem. Using this module it is possible to get your grid
credentials to any PKCS11-enabled application. The proxy is expected to
reside in the default location unless the X509_USER_PROXY is given.

The myproxy module makes it possible to access credentials in a remote
repository from PKCS11-enabled application.

The modules must be compiled and installed using the standard procedure.
After that they can installed in the application by standard way. To install
the module to applications from the Mozilla family you can also use the
install-pkcs11 script.

The implementation is heavily based on the soft-pkcs11 token Love Hörnquist
Åstrand, which is available from http://people.su.se/~lha/soft-pkcs11/
